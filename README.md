# F16-Radar-Display

This implements a functional F-16 radar display in GeoFS. You can find the controls in the options panel under "Controls".<br>
Note: if you click a control button and then try to press a keyboard button, it won't work because that's just HTML buttons being mouse prisons; you'll have to click on the screen and *then* press the key you wanted to press.

TODO:
- Implement locking targets (almost there)
- Switch to C-scope instead of PPI when locked
- Make it not run if the aircraft being flown does not have a fire-control radar in it
